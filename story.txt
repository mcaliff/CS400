It was a dark and rainy day, and our hero was very bored. He was all alone and stuck in the house, making him start to go a little bit crazy. He started talking to his cat and dog, but they could understand a single word he was saying. He then started making a house of cards hoping that it would be fun, but he couldn't get it past the second level without it falling. He went to to do a puzzle that his Grandma had gotten him, but after a while, he realized a couple of pieces were missing. It seemed as though nothing was going his way.
